# Bristol Stock Exchange Trading Strategies Comparison Project

This project involves a comprehensive comparison of different trading strategies described in the Bristol Stock Exchange (BSE) created by Dave Cliff. The focus is on analyzing how these strategies perform under various conditions and configurations. 
These trading strategies are described succinctly on the [BSE Wiki page](https://github.com/davecliff/BristolStockExchange/wiki).

## Repository Contents

- **Report**: The report presents findings from four distinct sets of trials:
  - **Trial 1**: Comparison of SHVR and ZIC strategies at an equal ratio.
  - **Trial 2**: Comparison of SHVR and ZIC strategies at different ratios.
  - **Trial 3**: Comparative analysis of SHVR, ZIC, ZIP, and GWVY strategies at various ratios.
  - **Trial 4**: Examination of ZIPSH vs. ZIC strategies in different market conditions.
